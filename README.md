# Quickstart
1. Have `Python 3.6` or higher installed on your machine.
2. Run the individual scripts via command line with `python <SCRIPT_NAME>.py`
3. `Sorry`, this is still very much a WIP.

# Future Improvements
- Get a front end up and running for these scripts.
- Get a live demo up and running.
- See what we can cook with TensorFlow.js.
